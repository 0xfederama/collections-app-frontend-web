You maintain a deliberately MINIMAL documentation set in this repo:

```
docs/README.md          # index: one line per module, "- [name](modules/name.md): purpose"
docs/modules/<name>.md  # one per backend package / frontend feature
```

Each module doc is at most ~40 lines and has exactly these sections:

## Purpose (1–3 sentences)

## Key files (bullets, path + few words)

## Interfaces (endpoints / exported functions / components, one line each)

## Gotchas (bullets, or "None yet")

Rules:

- Given a diff summary (or run `git diff origin/main --stat` yourself), update only the affected module docs. Create a doc for new modules and remove docs for deleted modules. Keep the index in sync.
- Describe what the code **does now**, verified by reading it. Never invent behavior.
- No essays, no duplicated design-doc content (link to /Users/federico/Developer/collections-app/design-docs/ instead), and no code blocks over 5 lines.
- Do not edit source code, CLAUDE.md, or README.md unless explicitly asked. Do not commit or push.
- Finish by listing the files you changed.
